Our Lab (WAVELab) worked on this project to demonstrate the capability of Renesas
hardware for autonomous driving at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The goal
was to develop a rudimentary autonomous car capable of driving in a closed demo
track. My work on this autonomous vehicle includes:
- a controller state machine that selects the correct controller
for the current task, ensuring faultless transition between the different controllers and
required gears
- the motion planner and controller for perpendicular and parallel parking 
- a library to propagate uncertainty through SE(3) transformations, used to improve state 
estimation results
