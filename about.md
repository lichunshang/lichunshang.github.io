#### TL;DR
I am currently a Master's student at the University of Toronto in the field of
autonomous vehicles. I build robots.

In grade nine, a friend of mine invited me to check out my high school’s robotics club. I have always enjoyed building things in the past, from simple DC motors, to rubber band powered helicopters, to small solid-fuel rockets. The opportunity to work on robots every day after school was irresistible, and that began my path in the field of robotics. Throughout my time in the robotics team, I participated extensively in VEX, FTC, and FRC robotic competitions. This experience led me to study Mechatronics at the University of Waterloo.

At Waterloo, I joined the robotics team and we competed in the University Rover Challenge. Before I graduated from the undergraduate program, I was leading the sub-teams in mechanical, autonomy, and systems aspects of the rover. In addition, I helped to manage the team’s business, finance, and recruitment efforts.

For my final internship before graduation, I worked as a research assistant at the university on a project on lane detection for self-driving cars. I gained exposure to the field of autonomous vehicles and decided to pursue a Master’s degree in this field. I am currently finishing my Master’s degree and I am pumped for a future career in robotics.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, hiking, canoeing, and archery.
